                <h2>Crop Recommendation System </h2>
                <p>A Crop Recommendation System using the Naive Bayes algorithm is a machine learning-based 
                    project that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions 
                    such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The Naive
                     Bayes classifier analyzes historical agricultural data and probabilistically predicts the best crop
                      by learning patterns from labeled datasets. This system aids farmers in making data-driven decisions, 
                      optimizing yield, and improving agricultural efficiency by offering intelligent, location-specific crop
                       recommendations.</p>

                <h2>Football Match Analysis Using YOLO Algorithm</h2>
                <p>
                    Football match analysis using the YOLOv8 model leverages real-time object detection to 
                    track players, the ball, referees, and key field elements. YOLOv8's speed and accuracy
                     make it ideal for analyzing match footage by detecting and classifying small, fast-moving
                      objects across frames. This allows for the extraction of tactical data such as player positions,
                       ball trajectories, and team formations, which can be used to generate heatmaps, track movement 
                       patterns, and support performance analysis or strategy development in professional football.

                <h2>MEAN full-stack Ecommerce Project</h2>
                <p>A MEAN stack eCommerce project utilizes MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js to build a full-stack online
                     shopping platform. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, handles user authentication, product management, 
                     order processing, and secure API endpoints, while MongoDB stores user, product, and transaction data. The Angular 
                     frontend provides a responsive and dynamic user interface for browsing products, managing carts, and completing 
                     purchases. This project demonstrates a complete understanding of full-stack development, API integration, and database
                      management, making it ideal for showcasing real-world skills in scalable web application development.</p>
